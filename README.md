# Fake Feeder

Fake Feeder is a browser extension that can send random fake requests to google, facebook and other plattforms that collect your data to generate an unpredictable AI-based feed for you.
So Fake Feeder feeds feeds with fakes.

This will ensure your pricacy by randomizing your data and preferences. Hopefully even kicks you out of your social media bubble.

## How to feed feeds fakes

Currently you'll have to manually click on the button in your extension bar and then click on the "Send Random Query" button.
This will send a random search query to google for your account.

## Currently supported plattforms

At this point randomized queries will only be sent to Google

## Planned plattforms

* Facebook
* Twitter
* Youtube
* Reddit
* Instagram
* Snapchat
* Tiktok
* Anything else that collects user data and is not in control of the naural networks generated from it
